        <h1>Block Group Selection - Instructions</h1>

        <p>Welcome to the Block Group Selection tool! Follow the steps below to identify and assess areas with challenges in computer science education. You will select block groups, choose a relevant challenge, and then verify your selections before submitting.</p>

        <h2>Steps to Complete the Selection:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Select a block group on the map that you believe faces challenges in computer science education.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Choose a challenge from the list provided below that you think best represents the issue in the selected block group.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> After selecting a challenge, repeat the process for each block group you wish to assess.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once you've selected a challenge for all block groups, review your selections.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> If everything looks good, click the "Submit" button to finalize your selections.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges in Computer Science Education:</h2>

        <!-- List of challenges -->
        <div class="definition">
            <strong>Limited Access to Qualified Teachers:</strong> There is a shortage of certified computer science teachers in many districts, making it challenging to offer comprehensive courses.
        </div>
        <div class="definition">
            <strong>Resource Constraints:</strong> Some schools may lack the necessary resources, such as up-to-date technology, to effectively teach computer science.
        </div>
        <div class="definition">
            <strong>Curriculum Integration:</strong> Integrating computer science into the existing curriculum can be difficult as schools prioritize other subjects due to standardized testing.
        </div>
        <div class="definition">
            <strong>Awareness and Interest:</strong> There may be a lack of awareness or interest among students and parents about the importance of computer science education and its career opportunities.
        </div>
        <div class="definition">
            <strong>Policy and Support:</strong> Initiatives like CS4GA are aimed at improving computer science education, but consistent policy support and funding are crucial.
        </div>
        <div class="definition">
            <strong>Equity and Access to Opportunities:</strong> Many students in rural and underserved districts lack access to computer science courses, creating a digital divide.
        </div>
        <div class="definition">
            <strong>Diversity and Inclusion:</strong> Underrepresented groups, including students from low-income backgrounds, minority communities, and girls, often have less exposure to computer science education.
        </div>
        <div class="definition">
            <strong>Technological Infrastructure Challenges:</strong> Some districts lack the necessary technology (e.g., computers, reliable internet) to support computer science instruction.
        </div>
        <div class="definition">
            <strong>Grant and Funding Opportunities:</strong> Identifying low-exposure areas allows schools to apply for state and federal grants aimed at expanding CS education programs.
        </div>
        <div class="definition">
            <strong>More Specific Reasons:</strong> You are also encouraged to give more specific reasons, if you have any.
