# Research-project
Welcome to our innovative research project! This web application has been specifically designed for Georgia high school teachers to actively contribute to the identification of areas with low student exposure to computer science (CS) education. Here's a step-by-step guide on what is expected from participants in this survey:

1. Select District and School: Begin by choosing your district and school from the provided options.
2. Explore the Map: Once selected, the application will display a map showcasing the surrounding areas, complete with established school zone boundaries, main roads, and landmarks.
3. Identify Low CS Exposure Regions: Using the interactive features, mark regions on the map where you perceive low exposure to computer science education. This can be achieved through block-specific clicks or freehand shape drawing, allowing you to pinpoint areas of concern.
4. Express Confidence Levels: After marking the regions, express your confidence levels in your assessments. Choose from low, medium, or high confidence levels to provide a nuanced understanding of your evaluation.
5. Articulate Influencing Factors: Further enhance your input by specifying influencing factors from a predefined list that contribute to the perceived low CS exposure. Additionally, you have the option to add custom factors, ensuring a comprehensive overview of the challenges involved.

The overarching objective of this survey is to empower educators like yourself to collaboratively identify areas lacking in computer science exposure. Your collective insights will contribute to a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by students in different regions.

The data collected will be utilized to validate the Co-SEA Risk Index, a metric designed to score census block groups based on their risk of limited access to CS education. This scoring system enables stakeholders to strategically deploy interventions where they are most needed, thereby fostering a broader participation in computing education.

Thank you for your valuable contribution to this initiative, as your insights play a crucial role in shaping the future of computer science education in Georgia high schools.
