<h2>Challenges in Computer Science Education:</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Student Demographics:</strong> Underrepresented groups (race/ethnicity, gender, etc.) often have less exposure to CS education.</li>
    <li><strong>Economic Barriers:</strong> Many students face financial hardship, limiting their ability to access CS resources and programs.</li>
    <li><strong>Language Barriers:</strong> Students in households where English is not the primary language may struggle with CS coursework.</li>
    <li><strong>Parental Education Level:</strong> Students with limited exposure to CS at home may have less encouragement or understanding of CS opportunities.</li>
    <li><strong>Limited or No Computer at Home:</strong> Some students lack access to a personal computer, making it harder to practice CS skills outside school.</li>
    <li><strong>Limited or No Reliable Internet Access:</strong> Without a stable internet connection, students may struggle with online CS resources and coursework.</li>
    <li><strong>Distance Challenges:</strong> A long commute or lack of transportation may prevent students from attending CS programs or extracurricular activities.</li>
    <li><strong>No or Limited Introductory CS Courses:</strong> Some schools do not offer foundational CS courses, preventing early exposure to the field.</li>
    <li><strong>No or Limited Advanced CS Courses:</strong> Schools may lack advanced CS coursework, restricting students' ability to deepen their knowledge.</li>
    <li><strong>Other Contributing Factors:</strong> You may also specify additional reasons that impact CS education access in your area.</li>
